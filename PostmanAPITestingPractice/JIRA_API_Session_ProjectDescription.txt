Project Description: JIRA API Session Automation

This project, named "JIRA_API_Session," is designed to automate various tasks related to the JIRA API. It utilizes Postman, a popular API development and testing tool, to perform the automation tasks. The project consists of a collection of API requests and associated scripts, enabling users to perform actions such as authentication, issue creation, comment addition, issue retrieval, issue deletion, and comment update.

The project structure is as follows:

GetAuthCookie:

This request is responsible for obtaining the authentication cookie required for subsequent API requests.
The request is a POST method that sends the username and password as the request body.
Upon receiving the response, a script is executed to extract the session cookie and store it in the Postman environment variable "sessionCookie."

CreateIssue:

This request creates a new issue in JIRA.
The request is a POST method that requires the JSESSIONID cookie obtained from the previous request for authentication.
The request body contains the necessary information for the new issue, such as project key, summary, description, and issue type.
After a successful response, a script is executed to extract the issue ID and store it in the Postman environment variable "issueID."

AddCommentToIssue:

This request adds a comment to an existing JIRA issue.
The request is a POST method that also requires the JSESSIONID cookie for authentication.
The request body includes the comment text and its visibility settings.
Upon receiving a response, a script is executed to extract the comment ID and store it in the Postman environment variable "commentID."

GetIssue:

This request retrieves detailed information about a specific JIRA issue.
The request is a GET method that requires the JSESSIONID cookie for authentication.
The issue ID is provided in the URL path, which is replaced dynamically using the "issueID" environment variable.
The response provides information such as issue status, description, and assignee.

DeleteIssue:

This request deletes a JIRA issue.
The request is a DELETE method that requires the JSESSIONID cookie for authentication.
The issue ID is provided in the URL path, using the "issueID" environment variable.

UpdateComment:

This request updates an existing comment on a JIRA issue.
The request is a PUT method that also requires the JSESSIONID cookie for authentication.
The request body contains the updated comment text and visibility settings.
The comment ID and issue ID are provided in the URL path, utilizing the "commentID" and "issueID" environment variables, respectively.
By utilizing this collection of requests and associated scripts, users can perform automated actions on JIRA issues through the JIRA API. The project provides a foundation for testing, integration, or other automation tasks related to JIRA's functionality.

Please note that the project assumes the presence of a valid JIRA base URI and appropriate environment variable configurations for the username and password required for authentication.
